# LCTweaks
Adds a number of minor, configurable tweaks to the game.

**Features**
- Makes the sprint key toggle sprint, rather than requiring it to be held. Can be toggled in the config.
- Adds a key to toggle auto walk, can be rebound using the ingame settings menu.
- Hold drop to drop all of your items at once. Time that the key must be held is configurable.
- Increases the maximum number of scannables that can be pinged at once. Max number of scannables is configurable.
  - **Note:** Each additional scannable above 13 will consume a very small amount of memory, so don't go crazy with this!
- Allows scrap items deposited in the ship to be scanned through walls. Can be toggled in the config.
- Makes it so that typing the name of a mine in the terminal causes it to detonate, rather than temporarily disable. Can be toggled in the config.
- Detonated mines have their name disappear from the radar.
- Causes dogs to be deaf to noises coming from near the terminal. Can be toggled in the config.
  - This one is really nice if anyone in your crew doesn't like horror, as it should reduce the likelihood of them being killed by dogs while manning the terminal.
- Show approximate health of players by coloring their radar icons. Can be toggled in the config.

# Installation
Nothing special, just the same as any other BepInEx-reliant mod. Make sure that you have InputUtils installed though!

# Known bugs/Misc notes
- Auto-walk and hold-to-drop do seem to not work with certain mods, not certain which ones though.
- If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to post an issue on the [Github repo](https://github.com/coderCleric/lctweaks_pub)
